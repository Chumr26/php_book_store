all the page (the container in the main content) have top margin 20px, except the home page
why there is no admin user in the list
Why i get this error (Email hoặc mật khẩu không đúng.) when using the autofill account
re design the ui of the dropdown selection box
- don't need to show the toaster when login and logout
- why there is no admin user in the list
- add auto fill account for admin login
- in the index.php file at the root directory, there is no route for admin login page, how the website reute me to there?
- i want to have a api for book author so that, i can get their info and their avatar to display, is there any public api for me to use?
- fully implement the sidebar on the books page
- implement the display list or grid button
- the hero slider over flow y, cause vertical scroll bar to appear
- implement the remaining pages
- the badge of the cart in the header only account for distinct book, not one book with quatity
- use modal not use browser default confirm dialog
- the same problem of the book cover in the book details page, also enlarge the book cover in the book details page
- remove the top bar ui, and update the layout of the header
- redesing the account button in the header
- the cover of some book is small, i know that the cover api sometime return small cover, that is ok, but if the iamge is small we can expand it to fill the container, i want to have a consistent size cover despire the resolution
- the "add to cart" button is not consistent, for example, it show "Đã thêm vào giỏ hàng" but when naviget to the book detail of that book the button still show "Thêm vào giỏ", i want it consistent, 
- remove the quatity input in the book detail page because user can't update quantity in cart page, update the layout accordingly after that
- the book detail page still use browser default confirm dialog, update the ui to use modal like other places in the project for consitensy
- create plan to fully implement the admin site

- update ui the "danh mục sách"
